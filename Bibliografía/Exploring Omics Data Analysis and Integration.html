You canâ€™t imagine modern healthcare without data science. Bioinformatics
 â€“ a modern area of study that sits between biology, medicine, 
mathematics, and computer science â€“ is using complex software and big 
data analysis to understand a disease better than it was ever possible, 
and is succeeding at it. Such bioinformatic databases as BLAST, Ensembl,
 or GenBank allow pharmaceutical companies, clinicians, and biologists 
to access large-scale omics data for research and diagnostic purposes.<br><br>Bioinformatics
 methods and tools have been growing so fast that soon every 
biolaboratory might have its own bioinformatician who could derive 
crucial knowledge about the patientâ€™s molecular system to provide better
 care. In this article, we want to talk about why omics data analysis is
 such a popular research topic and different methods of integrating it.
<h2 id="what-is-omics-data-and-where-is-it-used">What is omics data and where is it used?</h2>
Omics data is information generated by studies ending with -omics: genomics, proteomics, phenomics, etc.<br><br>It
 all started with genomics. When the field of genomics first appeared, 
it was principally different from genetics since it focused on studying 
the whole genome rather than single genes. Then proteomics, 
metabolomics, phenomics, and others followed suit, being dedicated to 
describing the complete protein profile rather than separate proteins or
 the whole metabolic level instead of one separate metabolite.<br><br>So,every area of study whose name ends in -omic belongs to <strong>the omics fields of study</strong>. This includes the following disciplines:
<ul>
 	<li>genomics (the study of a personâ€™s genome);</li>
 	<li>proteomics (the study of proteomes, a set of proteins in an organism);</li>
 	<li>metabolomics (the study of metabolites, small molecules within cells produced during metabolism);</li>
 	<li>metagenomics (the study of genetic materials recovered from natural environments);</li>
 	<li>phenomics (the study of total phenotypic characteristics of an organism);</li>
 	<li>transcriptomics (the study of RNA transcripts produced by a genome).</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><em>An overview of omics disciplines and what they study</em></p>
As we already mentioned, data generated by omics studies is called <strong>omics data</strong>.
 Compared to a non-omics study, omics research generates a much larger 
data output. Omics data provides a comprehensive understanding of the 
underlying structure of a biological system to expand scientific 
research. For example, omics data generated by the Human Genome Project 
has been incredibly helpful to the understanding of problems in human 
disease, agriculture, plant science, microbiology, the environment, and 
more.<br><br>The Human Genome Project is an example of a <strong>single omics study</strong>,
 where data is analyzed using one assay (method), for example genomics, 
transcriptomics, or metabolomics. But recently, new tools, technology, 
and approaches have allowed us to use multi-omics techniques. In <strong>multi-omics studies</strong>,
 you can combine datasets of different omics groups for analysis to get a
 holistic view of human health. This revolutionary shift gives way to 
truly personalized, <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/precision-medicine/">precision medicine</a>.<br><br>Some of the most prominent examples of omics data use cases involve the following.
<h3 id="precision-medicine">Precision medicine</h3>
Medicine applies many different methods when providing diagnostics and 
care, including studying the patientâ€™s medical history, laboratory 
evaluation, physical examination, and more. One of the ways we can 
significantly improve the accuracy and efficacy of treatment is by also 
evaluating the disease on the molecular level.<br><br>Instead of going 
through many standard tests, patients with complex cases and rare 
conditions can get a diagnosis much easier through phenotyping or genome
 sequencing. At the same time, patient data and samples can be used by 
researchers in further studies, guiding new discovery and treatment.
<h3 id="food-science-and-personalized-nutrition">Food science and personalized nutrition</h3>
The complexity of relationships between human bodies and food makes it 
very difficult to understand how dietary components would react in an 
organism. But nutrigenomics â€“ a nascent field of study exploring the 
relationship between genetics and diet via omics analysis â€“ may help 
provide truly personalized dietary advice.<br><br>Not only that, the 
combination of different omics could become an advanced tool for public 
health research and human studies that would provide valuable 
information about the nutritional status of certain populations and 
develop programs to improve it.
<h3 id="agricultural-biotechnology">Agricultural biotechnology</h3>
Omics technologies have been successfully applied to studying and 
manipulating nutritive and economic qualities of crop plants. Genome 
sequencing and genetic mapping have long allowed us to produce better 
plants such as seedless watermelons and vitamin-packed broccoflowers.<br><br>Omics
 technologies enable us to enhance the nutritional properties of food 
with precision to develop functional products that contain increased 
vitamin levels and better protein quality to address specific 
conditions. Since omics can give us insight that we wouldn't have 
acquired otherwise, we can improve food and energy supply, help preserve
 the environment, and even solve world hunger in the long run.
<h3 id="treating-age-related-diseases-and-disabilities">Treating age-related diseases and disabilities</h3>
Although in the past decades the average life expectancy has 
dramatically increased, that life hasnâ€™t been disease-free. While 
achieving older age many people can survive age-related diseases and 
disabilities, they still suffer from them. Human aging is a complex 
topic, influenced by diet, gender, socioeconomic status, and, of course,
 genetics. Thatâ€™s why we need to look at aging through an integrated 
lens. Omics data is tasked to finally provide such a view.<br><br>The 
employment of multi-omics tools has resulted in the development of 
methods and platforms for omics data integration, analysis, and 
visualization. In this article, we will cover some of them that are 
heavily featured in bioinformatics studies.<br><br>But first, letâ€™s review the main sources of multi-omics datasets
<h2 id="omics-dataset-repositories">Omics dataset repositories</h2>
There are a few depositories of publicly available multi-omics patient 
data that can be used for disease research, diagnostics, and treatment 
development.
<h3 id="the-cancer-genome-atlas-tcga-â€“-the-largest-source-for-cancer-omics-data">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) â€“ the largest source for cancer omics data</h3>
With over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data,<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga"> the Cancer Genome Atlas</a> is the largest collection of multi-omics datasets spanning 33 cancer types and over 20,000 tumor samples.<br><br>On the <a href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">Genomic Data Commons portal</a>
 that hosts TCGA, you can discover and review over 86,000 conveniently 
categorized cases, search projects, launch analyses, and, of course, 
browse and download data.<br><br><picture width="1025" height="671" class="wp-image-27676" alt="GDC Data Portal interface"><source srcset="Exploring%20Omics%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Integration_files/a604d378-31f9-4445-8231-b27378f6a0ac.webp 1x" type="image/webp"><img width="1025" height="671" src="Exploring%20Omics%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Integration_files/a604d378-31f9-4445-8231-b27378f6a0ac.jpg" alt="GDC Data Portal interface" loading="lazy"></picture>

<h2 id="challenges-of-omics-data-analysis-and-how-to-approach-them">Challenges of omics data analysis and how to approach them</h2>
The diversity and volumes of omics data make it a subject of <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/big-data-analytics-explained/">big data analytics</a> and require the use of advanced computational methods such as machine learning and <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/deep-learning/">deep learning</a>.
 Unfortunately, just as itâ€™s useful and integral to modern scientific 
research, the adoption of omics data also presents challenges that donâ€™t
 currently have standardized solutions.<br><br>If we talk about 
multi-omics data, which combines datasets of different omics groups for 
even a more holistic view of human health, the situation is even more 
difficult.<br><br>So omics data may be challenging to use for the following reasons.
<h3 id="the-curse-of-dimensionality">The curse of dimensionality</h3>
This phenomenon from data science refers to the problem when the number 
of variables in the dataset exceeds the number of samples, which creates
 data sparsity for an ML model. In biological studies, this happens when
 you gather a substantially large amount of data from a small sample of 
patients. The problem grows in multi-omics studies when we take 
measurements from multiple platforms, significantly increasing the 
variable number.<br><br>So omics datasets often need to go through 
dimensionality reduction either by feature extraction (creating new 
features from the existing ones) or feature selection (identifying only 
relevant features).
<h3 id="missing-data">Missing data</h3>
Generally, itâ€™s a common problem for omics datasets to have missing 
values, for instance, when the test that can obtain that data is costly 
and available only for a fraction of samples. But the problem is 
highlighted in multi-omics analysis, where there can be even more 
samples with missing data.<br><br>To handle this problem, there are various methods you may apply. Thereâ€™s <em>listwise deletion</em>,
 meaning excluding the entire sample if the data for any variable is 
missing. Of course, this leads to substantial information loss. Another 
method is called <em>imputation</em>, where a regression model replaces missing values with a mean or median of the available variables. Read our article on <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/synthetic-data-generation/">synthetic data</a> to learn about modern approaches to handling the missing value problem.
<h3 id="hosting-and-accessing-multi-omics-data">Hosting and accessing multi-omics data</h3>
Thereâ€™s currently no unified public infrastructure for hosting 
multi-omics data. There are various omics data repositories but there 
are no consistent standards and protocols, making it difficult to find 
and access it.<br><br><picture width="760" height="403" class="wp-image-27686" alt="Lifebit CloudOS interface Source: Lifebit"><source srcset="Exploring%20Omics%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Integration_files/5fa86261-2e1e-4e2e-867d-559dde599d2b.webp 1x" type="image/webp"><img width="760" height="403" src="Exploring%20Omics%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Integration_files/5fa86261-2e1e-4e2e-867d-559dde599d2b.jpg" alt="Lifebit CloudOS interface Source: Lifebit" loading="lazy"></picture>

There are commercial products like ones by <a href="https://www.lifebit.ai/lifebit-cloudos/">Lifebit</a> or <a href="https://www.sevenbridges.com/platform/">SevenBridges</a> that provide cloud platforms to host your omics data. Lifebit, for instance, has some <a href="https://opendata.lifebit.ai/">open data</a> available for analysis. But thereâ€™s still work to do in terms of addressing all possible study designs.
<h3 id="big-data-scalability">Big data scalability</h3>
Normally, <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/whitepapers/machine-learning-bridging-between-business-and-data-science/">machine learning</a>
 models improve their performance with the availability of more data. 
But when data is acquired via multi-omics platforms, scalability 
challenges may rise. For instance, itâ€™s unfeasible to analyze 
multi-omics using ML methods on a single computer. Or sometimes you 
canâ€™t train models on the entire dataset at once. Also in some studies, 
training samples would arrive over time, so <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/real-time-analytics/">streaming analytics</a> must be applied.<br><br>For such large scale analyses, novel computationally efficient algorithms and cloud computing solutions like <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/comparing-machine-learning-as-a-service-amazon-microsoft-azure-google-cloud-ai-ibm-watson/">ML as a service</a> are being applied
<h3 id="heterogeneous-data">Heterogeneous data</h3>
Multi-omics analyses commonly suffer from data heterogeneity, when 
datasets have different numbers of variables and mismatched scaling, and
 are generated using different formats and platforms. Integrating these 
diverse data types into a single prediction model is challenging.<br><br>Decision
 trees, regression models, and neural networks are all used to combat 
this issue, as well as networks like HeteroMed, PARADIGM, or SNF that 
can handle raw text, numeric, and categorical data in <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/electronic-health-record-systems/#:~:text=An%20Electronic%20Health%20Record%20is,data%20in%20a%20structured%20way.">electronic health records</a> (EHRs).
<h2 id="joining-the-progress">Joining the progress</h2>
The advent of multi-omics research has resulted in the most 
comprehensive understanding of human disease weâ€™ve ever experienced. 
Once biology continues implementing and embracing data science, we will 
be able to predict disease advancements with unmatched accuracy, <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/ai-drug-discovery-repurposing/">discover new, more effective drugs</a>, and prevent suffering for millions of people worldwide.<br><br>But
 although you can use many data analysis platforms without programming 
or data science knowledge, those skills are integral for preprocessing 
data, interpreting it, and driving the research forward. In just a few

Bioinformatics â€“ a modern area of study that sits between biology, medicine, mathematics, and computer science â€“ is using complex software and big data analysis to understand a disease better than it was ever possible, and is succeeding at it.

Compared to a non-omics study, omics research generates a much larger data output. Omics data provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying structure of a biological system to expand scientific research. For example, omics data generated by the Human Genome Project has been incredibly helpful to the understanding of problems in human disease, agriculture, plant science, microbiology, the environment, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Human Genome Project is an example of a \u003cstrong\u003esingle omics study\u003c/strong\u003e, where data is analyzed using one assay (method), for example genomics, transcriptomics, or metabolomics. But recently, new tools, technology, and approaches have allowed us to use multi-omics techniques. In \u003cstrong\u003emulti-omics studies\u003c/strong\u003e, you can combine datasets of different omics groups for analysis to get a holistic view of human health.

In biological studies, this happens when you gather a substantially large amount of data from a small sample of patients. The problem grows in multi-omics studies when we take measurements from multiple platforms, significantly increasing the variable number.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo omics datasets often need to go through dimensionality reduction either by feature extraction (creating new features from the existing ones) or feature selection (identifying only relevant features).\\n\u003ch3 id=\\\"missing-data\\\"\u003eMissing data\u003c/h3\u003e\\nGenerally, itâ€™s a common problem for omics datasets to have missing values, for instance, when the test that can obtain that data is costly and available only for a fraction of samples. But the problem is highlighted in multi-omics analysis, where there can be even more samples with missing data.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo handle this problem, there are various methods you may apply. Thereâ€™s \u003cem\u003elistwise deletion\u003c/em\u003e, meaning excluding the entire sample if the data for any variable is missing. Of course, this leads to substantial information loss. Another method is called \u003cem\u003eimputation\u003c/em\u003e, where a regression model replaces missing values with a mean or median of the available variables.
